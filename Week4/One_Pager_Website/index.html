  <h1>RateMyGames.com</h1>
  <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
  <p>My webpage showcases new and upcoming videogames, discusses trends between old and new games, and rates games based on playability.</p>
  <h2>Long Description</h2>
  <p>Ratemygames.com will focus on providing information of the new and upcoming games and provide news as they happen. My goal for this website is to provide gamers with a one-stop-shop for news on games that are just coming out as well as ratings on older games for the gamer who wants to relive the classics. We’ll also provide areas for users of the site to provide any information or opinions they have on certain subjects to make the site more geared toward user opinions and to make visitors feel more in control of the opinions of the site.</p>
