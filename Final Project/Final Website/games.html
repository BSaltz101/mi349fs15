<p>"From the Creators of Halo and the company that brought you Call of Duty. In Destiny you are a Guardian of the last city on Earth, able to wield incredible power. Explore the ancient ruins of our solar system, from the red dunes of Mars to the lush jungles of Venus. Defeat Earth’s enemies. Reclaim all that we have lost. Become legend." -- Destiny Official Site"</p>
<p>Destiny is an interesting adaptation of the first person shooter, implementing the playstyle and physics of Call of Duty, the rpg and free roam aspects of games like Borderlands, and the depth of story and great music of Halo. However, it's story is somewhat lacking and easily finshed within the first day of purchasing the game. However the leveling, the character customization, multiplayer aspects, and the constant output of DLC have fans coming back. It's not that challenging, but it's definitely fun to play!</p>
